We define subsequence as any subset of an array. We define a subarray as a contiguous subsequence in an array.

Given an array, find the maximum possible sum among:

- all nonempty subarrays.
- all nonempty subsequences.

Write a fuction which returns the two values in the single Result class

Note that empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered.
